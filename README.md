#### Overview
An NSXMLParser helps java developers to read and parse XML files. It also reports parsing errors. For convenience, an NSXMLParser object in the following descriptions is sometimes referred to as a parser object. Unless used in a callback, the NSXMLParser is a thread-safe class as long as any given instance is only used in one thread.
